# Resume Analysis API Demo

This document explains how to demonstrate the integration between the backend and data science components for resume analysis.

## Overview

The resume analysis feature allows users to upload their resumes and get detailed analysis and feedback based on job descriptions. The backend serves as the bridge between the frontend and the data science component, handling:

1. Resume uploads
2. Job description processing
3. Integration with the data science analysis code
4. Storing and retrieving analysis results
5. Providing various views of the analysis (summary, recommendations, etc.)

## Running the Demo

To demonstrate the functionality, we've created a test script that shows the complete flow from uploading a resume to getting analysis results.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure the backend server is running
2. Ensure you have at least one job in the database
3. Have a valid authentication token

### Steps to Run the Demo

1. Update the configuration in `test_resume_analysis.py`:
   - Set `BASE_URL` to your backend URL (default: `http://localhost:8000`)
   - Set `JOB_ID` to an existing job ID in your database
   - Set `AUTH_TOKEN` to a valid authentication token

2. Run the test script:
   ```
   python test_resume_analysis.py
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Create a sample resume file if one doesn't exist
   - Upload the resume to the analyze endpoint
   - Retrieve the full analysis results
   - Get the analysis summary
   - Get improvement recommendations
   - Get user statistics

## API Endpoints

The resume analysis API includes the following endpoints:

1. `POST /api/v1/resume-analysis/analyze` - Upload and analyze a resume
2. `GET /api/v1/resume-analysis/results/{job_id}` - Get full analysis results
3. `GET /api/v1/resume-analysis/summary/{job_id}` - Get analysis summary
4. `GET /api/v1/resume-analysis/recommendations/{job_id}` - Get improvement recommendations
5. `GET /api/v1/resume-analysis/user/analyses` - Get all analyses for the current user
6. `GET /api/v1/resume-analysis/user/top-matches` - Get best job matches
7. `GET /api/v1/resume-analysis/user/stats` - Get user statistics
8. `GET /api/v1/resume-analysis/compare` - Compare analyses across multiple jobs

## Data Flow

1. Frontend uploads a resume and specifies a job ID
2. Backend saves the resume and extracts the job description
3. Backend calls the ResumeAnalyzer class, which integrates with the data science code
4. Data science code analyzes the resume against the job description
5. Analysis results are returned to the backend
6. Backend stores the results in the database
7. Frontend can retrieve various views of the analysis results

## Integration Points

The main integration point with the data science component is in the `ResumeAnalyzer` class, which:

1. Takes a resume file and job description as input
2. Calls the data science analysis code
3. Processes the analysis results
4. Returns structured data that can be stored and presented to users

## Next Steps

1. Test with real resumes and job descriptions
2. Fine-tune the analysis algorithms
3. Integrate with the frontend components
4. Add more advanced features like resume improvement suggestions
